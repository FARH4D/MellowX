    <h1 id = "title">Dealing with Depression and sad thoughts.</h1>
    
    <p id ="idkPara1">While feeling sad isn't unusual, unexplainable sadness is usually one of the
        primary signs of depression.
        BUT, this doesn't mean you have depression for sure :) </br>
        One of the things that makes it harder to recover normally is constantly looking for reasons to
        be sad and convincing yourself you are depressed. This can be caused by things such as constantly
        listening to sad music (I mean seriously?). </br> </br>
        If you are convinced you have depression or have constantly sad thoughts, it is good to approach
        a therapist but meanwhile, I am here to offer relief. </br> </br>
        There are really many ways to get rid of the sad thoughts in your head:
    </p>




    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Listen to music (preferably happy)</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Believe it or not, listening to happy music offers a large number of
            mental health benefits, including relief from sadness and other symptoms of depression while
            also helping to energize you. </br>
            Listening to music can encourage your brain to produce hormones like dopamine and serotonin. 
            These “happy hormones” have been linked to improvements in mood and reduced anxiety and 
            stress. </br> </br>

            Just try to avoid music that matches your mood. Wallowing can seem like a good way to get 
            those feelings out, but mournful tunes might end up worsening sadness or depression.
            Aim for upbeat music with a faster tempo. </br>
            If I may offer some recommendations ☺: </br> </br>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Talk to friends or loved ones</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">Many of the symptoms associated with sadness or 
            depression can prompt you to pull back from others rather than seek emotional support.</br>
            When feeling irritable, you might get frustrated with loved ones easily. You might 
            experience guilt over negative feelings toward others, your need to cancel plans, or your 
            disinterest in your usual activities. </br>

            If you don't have any friends or loved ones to talk to I suggest trying to play some social
            games online and make friends, in this era of technology it is actually incredibly easy
            to do so and very mentally rewarding. </br></br>
            Talking to people won't necessarily make your symptoms go away, but it can help the burden 
            seem lighter. You'll also have people you can turn to if you need additional support. </br></br>

    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Doing Meditation or Yoga</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">While this may sound generic, meditation and yoga are 
            actually two very excellent ways to help deal with sad thoughts and depression. They both help 
            to clear the mind and changes your response to negative thinking.</br></br>
            Meditation doesn't involve getting rid of or pushing away dark thoughts, it instead helps
            you notice and accept them before letting them go.</br> </br>

            Meditation can help you get to a point where you can: <br>
            - Notice the thought </br>
            - Accept it as a possibility </br>
            - Acknowledge that it is not the <em>only</em> possibility <br> <br>

            I highly recommend this website for a detailed guide on meditation and tips on learning
            how: <br><br>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Go outside and work out</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">Regular exercise is one of the best ways to ease
            sadness and depression. This is done by: </br></br>

            <strong>- Releasing feel-good endorphins,</strong> natural cannabis-like brain chemicals 
            (endogenous cannabinoids) and other natural brain chemicals that can enhance your sense of 
            well-being. <br>
            <strong>- Taking your mind off of wories</strong> so you can get away from the cycle of 
            negative thoughts that feed depression and anxiety. <br><br>

            Regular exercise also has many psychological and emotional benefits, too. It can help you: <br>

    <strong>- Gain confidence.</strong> Meeting exercise goals or challenges, even small ones, can boost 
    your self-confidence. Getting in shape can also make you feel better about your appearance. </br>
    <strong>- Get more social interaction.</strong> Exercise and physical activity may give you the 
    chance to meet or socialize with others. Just exchanging a friendly smile or greeting as you walk 
    around your neighborhood can help your mood. </br>
