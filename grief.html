    <h1 id = "title">Dealing with grief.</h1>
    
    <p id ="idkPara1">The pain of loss can be overwhelming, which is why grief is a natural response.
        It is the emotional suffering you feel when something or someone is taken away from you.
        Grieving is a highly individual experience which is why there is no right or wrong way to
        grieve.</br></br>
        How you grieve depends on many factors, including your personality and coping style, 
        your life experience, your faith, and how significant the loss was to you.
        </br></br>

        Firstly I want to remind you and be up front about the myths of grieving:</br> </br>
    </p>

    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">"The pain will go away faster if you ignore it"</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Trying to ignore pain or keeping it bottled in will
            always make it worse in the long run. For real healing, it is important to face your 
            grief and actively deal with it.
        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>


        <p id = "griefTitle2">"It is important to be strong in the face of loss"</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">Feeling sad or lonely is a completely normal
            reaction to loss. Crying doesn't mean you are weak and you do not need to put on a brave
            front in front of your family. </br></br>
            Showing your true feelings will help them and yourself. </br></br><br><br><br>
        </p>
    </div>

    

    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">"Grieving should last a year"</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">There is never a specific time period for grieving, it will 
            always differ from person to person.
        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>


        <p id = "idkTitle2">"Moving on with life means you have forgotten"</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">Moving on means you have accepted your loss, however 
            that is not the same thing as forgetting. </br>
            You can move on with your life while keeping the memory of someone or something you lost alive 
            within you as an important part of yourself.
        </br></br>
            As you move through life, these memories can become more and more integral to defining 
            the type of person you are and the choices you will make. </br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1 id = "title">Seeking support for grief and loss</h1>
    
    <p id ="idkPara1">Although the pain or grief can cause you to want to withdraw from others and 
        retreat into your shell, it is vital to have the face-to-face support of other people. Even if 
        you're not comfortable talking about your feelings under normal circumstances, it is important 
        to express them while grieving.
    </br></br>
        Seeking support for grief and loss: </br> </br>
    </p>



    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Turn to friends and family members</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Grieving is the time to lean on the people who care about 
            you, no matter how prideful or self sufficient you are, you should be leaning on your 
            family or friends during difficult times such as these rather than trying to avoid 
            them. </br></br>

            People often want to help but don't know how, so accept assistance and tell them what you 
            need—whether it's a shoulder to cry on, a listening ear, or just someone to hang out with.
            </br></br>
            If you don’t feel you have anyone you can regularly connect with in person, it's never too late 
            to <a href = "https://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships-communication/making-good-friends.htm">build new friendships.</a>
            
        </p>

        <p id = "griefTitle2">Accept the awkwardness from others</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">One major thing to know about opening up about grieving 
            is that many people feel awkward when trying to comfort someone who is grieving. </br> </br>
            Some of them might not know what to say if they haven't experienced a similar loss themselves 
            and may end up saying the wrong thing.</br></br>

            <em>HOWEVER</em> do not use that as an excuse to retreat into your shell and avoid social 
            contact. If a friend or loved one reaches out to you, it is because they genuinely care.
        
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Join a support group</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Grief can sometimes feel very lonely, even for those 
            blessed with close friends and family. This is why being able to share your sorrow with 
            others who have experienced similar losses can help a lot. </br></br>

            Finding a support group is simple if you want to find one just contact local hospitals, 
            hospices, funeral homes, or counseling centers.
            </br></br></br></br>
           
            
        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Talk to a therapist or grief counselor</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">If your grief feels like too much to bear, find a mental 
            health professional with experience in grief counseling.</br> </br>

            An experienced therapist can help you work through intense emotions and overcome obstacles 
            to your grieving.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>
