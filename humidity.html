    <h1 id = "title">THE EFFECTS OF HIGH HUMIDITY.</h1>


    <p id ="idkPara1">It has been known for many years now that the weather obviously has an effect 
        on our mental states. But, studies have shown that humidity has one of the greatest effects 
        when it comes to weather.
    </br></br>
        Of course there are multiple good reasons that a high humidity has such a bad effect on our 
        minds:</br> </br>

    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">It makes you forgetful</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Humidity appears to impair short-term memory, according to 
            a study that found people had a harder time remembering a string of numbers when it was 
            hot and sticky out.</br></br>
            As the authors explain it, the participants' cognitive resources were diverted away from the 
            test task and “given over to coping with the uncomfortable environment.”</br> </br>

        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">It makes you lethargic</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">One study published in the 1980s examined the 
            behavioral effects of several different weather conditions — including sunshine, rain, or 
            snow; temperature; wind; humidity; and barometric pressure — and found that humidity 
            was one of the best predictors of people's moods. </br></br>

            Specifically, the higher the humidity, the lower your energy level will likely be.

    <h1 id = "title">How to reduce humidity</h1>


    <p id ="idkPara1">High humidity also feels extremely awful, especially in your home during the summer.
        Fortunately, there are many different ways of reducing the humidity of your room:

    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Take cooler showers</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Hot showers = humid air.</br></br>
            We love hot showers as much as the next person, but they are the enemy of home comfort 
            in this scenario.</br> </br>
            We're not saying you have to switch to ice baths. By lowering the temperature of your 
            showers just a few degrees, you won't add as much steam to the air, which helps with 
            humidity levels.</br></br></br>

        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Get a dehumidifier</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">The most surefire way to reduce indoor humidity is to get 
            a dehumidifier.</br></br>

            Dehumidifiers remove moisture from the air as it passes through so by the time it reaches 
            you it's dry and cool, which is exactly what you want in the heat.</br> </br>
            Another great thing about dehumidifiers is that you get to use your air conditioners/fans 
            a lot less because low humidity levels means a cooler room.

    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Dry your laundry outside</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Most of us have clothes we can't put in the dryer. In the 
            winter, we use indoor drying racks. But in the summer, all those damp clothes will just help 
            make your home more humid.</br></br>
            We recommend hanging your clothes on an outside drying rack or clothes line whenever possible, </br> </br>
            If you need to hang clothes to dry indoors, you may want to purchase a dehumidifier. For any 
            home with a basement, this is a must.

        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Open a window</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">Sometimes just opening your window will help lower your 
            humidity levels.</br></br>

            However, you don't want to do this too much when your air conditioner is running. Otherwise, 
            you're spending money cooling air that is getting pulled outside.</br></br></br></br></br>
