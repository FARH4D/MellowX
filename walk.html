    <h1 id = "title">Go outside for a walk</h1>

    <p id ="idkPara1">
       Going on a walk can seem so simple yet is so effective for many reasons for a start exposing yourself to nature
       is extremly healthy, taking in fresh air, sun rays and being surrounded by nature not only will relieve stress and 
       improve your mood but it will also clear your mind and allow you to think more clearly. <br> <br>
    </p>



    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Parks</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS"> Parks are great places for walks as there is usually alot of others about as
            well as differnt animals such as dogs, ducks , squirrels and even birds all of which can imporve your mood and put 
            you at peace. Not only this its a great place to make friends. <br> <br>

        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Longer walks</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">Taking a long walk is a great way to find peace especially on a nice day, even
            consider bringing someone with you, as much as a walk alone can be great with someone else can be even better. 
            <br> You can enjoy the scenery or even have lunch on your walk and make a day out of it. Humans afterall thrive 
            walking especially longer walks in unknown locations as it is exploring there is a sense of uncetrainity and curiosity 
            and this is something that cant be overlooked. <br> <br>

            So not sure what to do today and feeleing down ? Message a friend and suggest going on a walk regardless if it be to 
            your local town or to a nature reserve either way it will certainly make you feel better.
