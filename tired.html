    <h1 id = "title">Constant tiredness and fatigue.</h1>
    
    <p id ="idkPara1">For people with depression, feeling tired is an all-too-common symptom.
        This is a common reason people who constantly feel tired or fatigued think they are depressed,
        however there is a big difference. </br></br>

        With depression, energy levels dip, and many of the symptoms, such as profound sadness and 
        loneliness, can further exacerbate fatigue. Here's why depression makes you tired, how to tell 
        if it's the cause of your fatigue, and how you can feel more refreshed and well-rested. </br> </br>

        Depression is likely associated with changes in brain neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, 
        norepinephrine, and serotonin. These neurotransmitters play important roles in regulating 
        energy levels, sleep, appetite, motivation, and pleasure.</br> </br>
    </p>

    <h1 id = "title">How to tell if you are depressed or just fatigued.</h1>

    <p id ="idkPara1">The symptoms of both depression and fatigue include low energy and low motivation
        or a loss of interest in pleasurable activities.</br></br>

        One distinguishing factor can be the desire to engage in activities â€” people who have fatigue 
        wish to do things, but lack energy, whereas people with depression have lower interest in 
        activities. </br> </br>

        Sometimes being constantly fatigued or depressed can even make it harder to sleep, but proper 
        sleep is <em>INCREDIBLY </em> important for your recovery. </br><br>
        Here are some ways for you to improve your sleep to get rid of constant fatigue:</br>

    </p>


    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Have a sleeping schedule</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Following a schedule in which you sleep and wake up at
            around the same time everyday is incredibly important as it makes it easier to fall asleep
            and wake up each day due to our body's circadian clock. </br></br>
            Not following a sleeping schedule is actually linked with obesity, hypertension and other 
            poor health outcomes so please do not underestimate the importance of a sleep routine. </br> </br>
            
        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Avoid caffeine and alcohol</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">One of the most important things is to stay away from
            alcohol and strongly avoid caffeine, as these will both inevitably worsen both your sleep 
            and depression. This includes energy drinks and fizzy drinks (as these also contain small 
            amounts of caffeine). </br></br><br><br><br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Keep screens out of the bedroom</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Another common issue is that people will be glued
            to their phones or other devices straight before sleeping. Don't watch tv or scroll through
            social media right before going to bed, ensure you are screen-free for at least an hour
            before sleeping.</br></br>

            The light from screens can interfere with the body's natural production of melatonin
            which helps with sleep.</br> </br>
            
        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Make a visit to your doctor</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">Perhaps the most obvious solution is making an appointment
            and talking to your doctor, this may seem obvious but it is incredibly important
            if nothing else is seeming to work. </br></br>
            There are many reasons your sleep might be suffering, and a doctor can help confirm that 
            there isn't another issue interfering with your sleep. </br></br>
        </p>

    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Schedule an early morning workout</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Doing a workout early in the day helps with mood and 
            sleep, also helping to build your sleep schedule. However, you should avoid high-intensity 
            workouts during the night as it may interfere with rest.
