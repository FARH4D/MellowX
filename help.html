    <p id ="idkPara1">
       Helping others is one of the most rewarding things someone can do not only are you bringing a positive
       impact to soemones life but you are also gaining a sense of self appreicattion and value by doing this 
       as you truly begin to realise the importance and impact you have on others. In a world where everyhting
       appears to run smoothly without people always helping others it is increasingly important to see just how 
       wrong that is and how much value and importance you bring to others.

    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Charity work</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS"> Doing charity work is not only helping the less fortunate but also
            provides a major sense of value as it is extremely rewarding mentally, it is the idea of helping someone 
            else without any intention of reciving anything that makes it so great. By having a task of importance 
            it will increase your understanding of your value and importance in the world, ie helping to distribute food
            to homeless people. If you failed to show up someone may go hungry and this is how you realise the importnace 
            of you as a person and the endless capabilties to help others you possess.

        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Helping your friends</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS"> Helping anyone is great but helping your friends in particular is an amazing 
            feeling as you know them on another level to soemone you dont meaning the impact you have on them would be 
            extremley visible, not sure where to start ? Simply ask them if they need help with anything or want to talk
            you will likely find they have something they want to get of their chest. <br> <br>

            Helping your friends will also come back to help you as they will remember your help and be there for you in your 
            times of need that is the beauty of good freindship so one can never underestimate its value as it is more powerful
            and valuable than many undertand it for.
