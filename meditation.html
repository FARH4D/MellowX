    <p id ="idkPara1">
       Meditaion is great to put it simply it is the practise of being at peace and reflecting on yourself within,
       it is quite a hard thing to grasp as it is easy to be naive and overlook the benefits of simply being at one
       with your mind and taking some time to reflect on everyhting. A great way to start is by watching these videos.

        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS"> Meditating outside especially in nature can be one of the most stress free
            things you can do as you are at one with nature and yourself and have some time to yourself to simply reflect
            on life which is something nobody truly does enough especially in a world where things are constantly happening. 
            <br> <br> So not feeling too good ? Go outside and relax for a while by meditating.

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Morning meditation</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS"> A habit that many of the greats have done is to meditate first thing in the morning,
            you may notice sometimes in the morning if not all the time you feel in a major rush and dont get a chance to think say 
            as if you are almost on auto pilot while this is what almost eveyrone does it is not the ideal start to the day. A day
            started on auto pilot will likely continute as such and therfore taking 5 minutes out of each morning to simply meditate
            and reflect can do wonders for your day. <br> <br> By knowing you have to find 5 minutes to meditate at least you know waking
            up earlier is key and you have a chance to reflect intetionally before the start of the day. <br> <br> <br>

            Setting the tone for the day before its even started is a great way to imporve how you feel as well as your produtivity and 
            performance for anyhting as it means any thoughts troubling you are now either solved or at least been thought through and allows
            you to see your inner thoughts rather than run from them. This may sound daunting but is actually extremly helpful and can make 
            you feel way better. <br> <br>
