        Here are several easy ways to look after your mental health:

            the first step in taking charge of your wellbeing and doing what you can to stay healthy. </br></br></br>

            Describing how you're feeling is not always easy but it's a way to cope with problems you've 
            been carrying in your head for a while. </br></br>Just being listened to can help you feel supported 
            and less alone, even writing about something that has made you angry in a journal is a good 
            way to let it out.

            Not following a sleeping schedule is actually linked with obesity, hypertension and other 
            poor health outcomes so please do not underestimate the importance of a sleep routine. </br> </br>

        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS"> There are strong links between what we eat and how we 
            feel, for example, caffeine and sugar can have an immediate effect.</br></br>
            But food can also have a long-lasting effect on your mental health. Your brain needs a 
            mix of nutrients to stay healthy and function well, just like the other organs in your 
            body.</br> </br>

            A healthy balanced diet includes: <br>
            - Lots of different types of fruit and vegetables </br>
            - Wholegrain cereals or bread </br>
            - Nuts and seeds </br>
            - Dairy products </br>
            - Oily fish </br>
            - Plenty of water <br> <br>

        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Exercise releases chemicals in your brain that make you 
            feel good, as a result, regular exercise can boost your self-esteem and help you to 
            concentrate, sleep and feel better.<br><br>
            Exercising doesn't necessarily mean going to the gym or doing a sport. Taking walks in the park, 
            gardening or even housework can keep you active. </br> </br>
            Experts say most people should do about 30 minutes exercise at least five days a week.
            </br>
            Try to make physical activity that you enjoy a part of your day or even do a sport or work out 
            with your family or friends :)

        <p id = "idkTitle2"></br>Take a break</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">A change of scene or a change of pace is good for your 
            mental health. It could be a five-minute pause from cleaning your kitchen, a half-hour lunch 
            break at work or a weekend exploring somewhere new. </br></br>

            Take a deep breathâ€¦ and relax. Try just putting your feet up or even some meditation<br><br>

            Taking a break may mean being active and moving around or it may mean not doing very much 
            at all.</br> </br>

            Listen to your body. If you're really tired, give yourself time to sleep. Without good 
            sleep, our mental health suffers and our concentration goes downhill. Sometimes the 
            world can wait.
