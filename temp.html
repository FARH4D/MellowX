    <h1 id = "title">THE EFFECTS OF HIGH TEMPERATURE.</h1>


    <p id ="idkPara1">Studies have concluded that cooler temperatures decrease the level of adverse 
        mental health outcomes and that warmer temperatures increase negative health outcomes.</br></br>
        For many years, scientists have studied how climate affects mental well-being. However, it is 
        often difficult to link temperature directly to health outcomes. As an example, a 2017 study 
        that focused on India found that suicide rates there peak in tandem with increasing 
        temperatures.</br></br>

        The main effects of high heat are as follows: </br></br>

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Lowers mental performance</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Ever had to work or walk outside in the summer and notice 
            that you're feeling a lot more tired than usual? Well, there's actually a good reason for 
            that.</br></br>
            A high temperature makes you lazy and less productive.</br></br>
            The hotter it is, the more energy you need to keep yourself cool, which means that even 
            activities you are used to doing easily can take a lot more effort than usual.</br> </br>

        
        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Increase of depressive thoughts</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS"> </br> An analysis by the University of Maryland's Howard Center 
            for Investigative Journalism found emergency response calls relating to psychiatric 
            conditions increased nearly 40% in Baltimore in the summer of 2018, when the heat index 
            spiked above 103.</br></br>

            Often, mental health patients are struggling with more than a mental illness. Studies have 
            linked heat and increased drug overdoses, as well as heightened effects of alcohol poisoning 
            - and the Howard Center found calls relating to substance abuse more than doubled during 
            dangerous heat in the summer of 2018.

    <h1 id = "title">How to reduce humidity</h1>


    <p id ="idkPara1">High humidity also feels extremely awful, especially in your home during the summer.
        Fortunately, there are many different ways of reducing the humidity of your room:

    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Take cooler showers</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Hot showers = humid air.</br></br>
            We love hot showers as much as the next person, but they are the enemy of home comfort 
            in this scenario.</br> </br>
            We're not saying you have to switch to ice baths. By lowering the temperature of your 
            showers just a few degrees, you won't add as much steam to the air, which helps with 
            humidity levels.</br></br></br>

        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Get a dehumidifier</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">The most surefire way to reduce indoor humidity is to get 
            a dehumidifier.</br></br>

            Dehumidifiers remove moisture from the air as it passes through so by the time it reaches 
            you it's dry and cool, which is exactly what you want in the heat.</br> </br>
            Another great thing about dehumidifiers is that you get to use your air conditioners/fans 
            a lot less because low humidity levels means a cooler room.

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Dry your laundry outside</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Most of us have clothes we can't put in the dryer. In the 
            winter, we use indoor drying racks. But in the summer, all those damp clothes will just help 
            make your home more humid.</br></br>
            We recommend hanging your clothes on an outside drying rack or clothes line whenever possible, </br> </br>
            If you need to hang clothes to dry indoors, you may want to purchase a dehumidifier. For any 
            home with a basement, this is a must.

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Open a window</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">Sometimes just opening your window will help lower your 
            humidity levels.</br></br>

            However, you don't want to do this too much when your air conditioner is running. Otherwise, 
            you're spending money cooling air that is getting pulled outside.</br></br></br></br></br>
