    <h1 id = "title">Dealing with Stress and Anxiety</h1>
    
    <p id ="idkPara1">Anxiety and stress are caused by persistent (and in some cases excessive) worry 
        about a number of different things. 
        If left unmanaged, stress and anxiety can start to interfere with your daily life and take a 
        toll on your physical and mental health. Including other symptoms such as trouble sleeping, 
        irritability or difficulty concentrating.</br></br>
        
        Although stress and anxiety are different things (stress is tied to a specific situation and is 
        resolved when the situation is resolved, while anxiety doesn't have a specific trigger), they 
        are still closely connected. </br> </br>
        It's common to experience stress and anxiety from time to time, and there are strategies to 
        help make them more manageable:
    </p>




    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Go outside and work out</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Regular exercise is one of the best ways to ease
            sadness and depression. This is done by: </br></br>

            <strong>- Releasing feel-good endorphins,</strong> natural cannabis-like brain chemicals 
            (endogenous cannabinoids) and other natural brain chemicals that can enhance your sense of 
            well-being. <br>
            <strong>- Taking your mind off of wories</strong> so you can get away from the cycle of 
            negative thoughts that feed depression and anxiety. <br><br>

            Regular exercise also has many psychological and emotional benefits, too. It can help you: <br>

    <strong>- Gain confidence.</strong> Meeting exercise goals or challenges, even small ones, can boost 
    your self-confidence. Getting in shape can also make you feel better about your appearance. </br>
    <strong>- Get more social interaction.</strong> Exercise and physical activity may give you the 
    chance to meet or socialize with others. Just exchanging a friendly smile or greeting as you walk 
    around your neighborhood can help your mood. </br></br>

        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Meditate</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">While this may sound generic, meditation is
            an amazing way to deal with stress and anxiety because it involves deep breathing, 
            which is a simple but efficient technique for stress reduction. It helps 
            to clear the mind and changes your response to negative thinking.</br></br>
            Meditation doesn't involve getting rid of or pushing away dark thoughts, it instead helps
            you notice and accept them before letting them go.</br> </br>

            Meditation can help you get to a point where you can: <br>
            - Notice the thought </br>
            - Accept it as a possibility </br>
            - Acknowledge that it is not the <em>only</em> possibility <br> <br>

            I highly recommend this website for a detailed guide on meditation and tips on learning
            how: <br><br>

    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Maintain healthy relationships</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Friends and family are a source of great happiness in 
            life, as well as great stress. </br></br>

            Studies of cortisol in hair show that children with a stable and warm family life have much
            lower levels of cortisol (a measure of stress) than children from homes with high levels 
            of conflict. Within couples, conflict results in a short-term elevation in cortisol, 
            followed by return to normal levels. </br></br>
            
            Of course, this just means that support from loved ones can also help reduce cortisol in the 
            face of stress.

            For example, one study showed that having an affectionate interaction (verbally or 
            physically) with a romantic partner or platonic friend before a stressful activity resulted 
            in lower stress-induced markers such as heart rate and blood pressure.

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Take care of a pet</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">Of course, relationships with animal companions can also 
            reduce cortisol. </br></br>

           In one study, interaction with a therapy dog reduced distress and cortisol during a minor 
           medical procedure in children. Another study involving 48 adults showed that contact with a 
           dog was better than support from a friend during a socially stressful situation.</br> </br>

           A third study tested the cortisol-reducing effect of canine companionship in pet owners 
           compared with those who were not pet owners, and the latter group experienced a greater 
           drop in cortisol when they were given canine companions, likely because pet owners had 
           already benefited from the friendship of their animals at the beginning of the study <br> <br>

          These effects are well known and are the reason many care homes and university/college 
          campuses have introduced pet therapy as a natural cortisol and stress reducing activity.
