    <h1 id = "title">Dealing with Stress and Anxiety</h1>
    
    <p id ="idkPara1">Anxiety and stress are caused by persistent (and in some cases excessive) worry 
        about a number of different things. 
        These sc</br>
        One of the things that makes it harder to recover normally is constantly looking for reasons to
        be sad and convincing yourself you are depressed. This can be caused by things such as constantly
        listening to sad music (I mean seriously?). </br> </br>
        If you are convinced you have depression or have constantly sad thoughts, it is good to approach
        a therapist but meanwhile, I am here to offer relief. </br> </br>
        There are really many ways to get rid of the sad thoughts in your head:
    </p>




    <div id = "idkSection" class = "SECTIONS">

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Listen to music (preferably happy)</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS">Believe it or not, listening to happy music offers a large number of
            mental health benefits, including relief from sadness and other symptoms of depression while
            also helping to energize you. </br>
            Listening to music can encourage your brain to produce hormones like dopamine and serotonin. 
            These “happy hormones” have been linked to improvements in mood and reduced anxiety and 
            stress. </br> </br>

            Just try to avoid music that matches your mood. Wallowing can seem like a good way to get 
            those feelings out, but mournful tunes might end up worsening sadness or depression.
            Aim for upbeat music with a faster tempo. </br>
            If I may offer some recommendations ☺: </br> </br>

        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Talk to friends or loved ones</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">Many of the symptoms associated with sadness or 
            depression can prompt you to pull back from others rather than seek emotional support.</br>
            When feeling irritable, you might get frustrated with loved ones easily. You might 
            experience guilt over negative feelings toward others, your need to cancel plans, or your 
            disinterest in your usual activities. </br>

            If you don't have any friends or loved ones to talk to I suggest trying to play some social
            games online and make friends, in this era of technology it is actually incredibly easy
            to do so and very mentally rewarding. </br></br>
            Talking to people won’t necessarily make your symptoms go away, but it can help the burden 
            seem lighter. You’ll also have people you can turn to if you need additional support. </br></br>
