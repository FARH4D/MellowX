       Working out is a great form of relief when you are feeling stressed or under pressure it helps not only by 
       improving physcial health but also mental health as you look good and feel good. <br><br> is also a great way to
       make new friends for example at the gym or in team sports. Working out is bound to improve your life quality
       and make you feel more confident and happier as consequence.

        <p id = "idkTitle1">Fitness</p>
        <p id = "idkPara2" class = "SECTIONS"> Being fit and in good shape offers so many benefits and is something
            many take for granted. It can help make you feel more energized and productive when you are in good shape
            so you get more done not only that your performance across all daily tasks will improve.Being fit also
            offers many health benefits long term throughout life especially as one gets older so is certainly worth
            taking seriosuly.

        </p>

        <p id = "idkTitle2">Gym</p>
        <p id = "idkPara3" class = "SECTIONS">Gym is perhaps one of the best places to go for those struggling with how
            they feel, not only can it transform your body and lifestyle habits but also your mindset, by starting the gym
            you can do many things such as weight training, calinsthenics and also cardio all of which have amazing communities
        of people who would always be willing to help. </br>

           If you dont know where to start I would suggest simply making a membership and showing up to the gym and asking someone
        for help although this may seem like a daunting task you will be suprised by how many people will be more than happy to help you. </br></br>
        The next step will be getting in a healthy habbit of going consistently I suggest first starting to go once a week and build a habit of going
        on one particular day/time then once you have done this increase up to as many days as you like that suits you and your scehdule.
